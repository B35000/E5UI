OK LISTEN, WE GET YOU. YOUR IN A TOUGH PLACE, LIFE ISNT WORKING OUT FOR YOU, YOUVE TRIED OUT STUFF BUT NOTHING WORKS. THATS LIFE. PICK YOURSELF UP, DUST YOURSELF OFF AND FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR YOU, LIFE ISNT FAIR, IT ISNT RIGHT AND IT TAKES TIME TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR YOU. WERE ALL IN THE SAME POSITION HERE. WERE ALL TRYING OUT STUFF JUST LIKE YOU. I MEAN LOOK AT ME, I ONLY EARN THREE CENTS AN HOUR, WORK FOUR JOBS, EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY INCLUDING SUNDAYS AND YOU DONT HEAR ME WHINING LIKE A LITTLE BITCH. FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO. CRYPTO ISNT SCALABLE. WE CANT USE IT. IM SORRY BUT THATS REALITY. ok fine, whatever ill just take the easy way out. OK THATS NOT SOMETHING TO BEAT YOURSELF UP ABOUT. SOME WORK OUT, SOME DONT. THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO TRY AND HAVE FUN DOING IT. AND LEARN FROM YOUR EXPERIENCES. THATS WHAT IT MEANS TO GROW AS AN INDIVIDUAL. yeah your right.  SO YEAH, JUST TAKE MY ADVICE. TAKE IT EASY. DONT FEEL SO PRESSURED. ITS NEVER THAT SERIOUS. its just that our banker overlords are so hard on us these days, it feels like im making gold yet they get to earn 70 trillion a month with paid leave, overtime and vacations plus bonuses, while the rest of us earn slave wages, its not fair. LIFES NOT FAIR. I KNOW. BUT THATS HOW IT IS. YOUVE GOTTA TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT, MOST OF US DO. JUST PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN AND DO THE WORK JUST LIKE WE DO. I PROMISE IT WILL GET BETTER. SOMETHING BETTER WILL COME ALONG. IM SURE OF IT. if only that were true. if only that were true."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/E5UI/app_icon.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/E5UI/manifest.json"/><title>E5(Beta)</title><script defer="defer" src="/E5UI/static/js/main.ec2d3444.js"></script><link href="/E5UI/static/css/main.19802a6a.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
